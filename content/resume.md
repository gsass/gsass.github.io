# Experience

## 2015-Present Warby Parker - Software Developer

Worked across the stack (JS/React,Python/Tornado,PSQL, AWS) to improve Warby’s e-commerce, retail, and administrative tooling. Currently focusing on prescriptions in order to make it easier to buy Rx glasses
Built out the data access layer, API integration, and task queueing to integrate a telemedicine solution to measure changes to prescription with our admin interface.
Refined features of our inventory system, extending the business cases to track and account for lenses as inventory, and adding stock buffers for retail availability.
Developed the API endpoint and front-end flow to upload prescriptions online through our e-commerce site, reducing order lead time for online sales by a half day.
Previously delivered features to make retail systems more resilient and easier to use (e.g. a React/Redux retail performance monitoring dashboard for the POS we used in 50+ stores). Upcoming: converting an A/B testing suite to support multi-arm bandit tests.

## 2013-15 Vecna Technologies – Software Developer

Designed and implemented (in Java/Backbone.js) front and back-end components of an online medical information portal deployed to >50,000 patients internationally. Wrote an integration for health record serialization and import, acting as technical liaison for the release of this feature to a client. Helped co-workers and interns to use git better.

## 2010-13 Draper Laboratory – Technical Staff

Developed a distributed, modular platform for testing multiple families of inertial measurement units with sensor rates ranging from 1-4800 Hz and test lengths ranging from 10 seconds to 5 days. Continued robotics research performed during my undergraduate degree, improving GPS waypoint following of an autonomous, wheeled, all-terrain vehicle.
