# Experience & Education

## 2015-Present Warby Parker - Software Developer

Improved WP's ability to do business in-store and online by developing and supporting full-stack features. Made it easier to update and use features previously in our backend monolith (e.g. prescription validation and lens fulfillment) by breaking then out into microservices.

Delivered improvements to our retail frontend experience such as a React/Redux retail performance monitoring dashboard for the POS we used in 50+ stores. Added the ability to access our telemedicine solution from our in-store POS.

Integrated the telemedicine solution and admin+POS backend, adding API endpoints and scheduled tasks so as to automate order processing, transcription, and reporting. Worked  with our ops team to improve the stability of that intregration.

Stack: JS/React, Python/Tornado, PSQL, AWS

## 2013-15 Vecna Technologies – Software Developer

Added and maintained an integration for health record serialization and import to Vecna's electronic health record solution, deployed to &gt;50,000 patients internationally. Acted as technical liaison for the initial release of this feature to a client. Improved messaging and patient reporting for this system. Taught co-workers and interns to use git better.
