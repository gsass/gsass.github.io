      <p>I'm George. I make software, usually to make the internal tools and web store at <a href="https://www.warbyparker.com">Warby Parker</a> better. Currently I work across our <small>(Python/JSâ€“ES6,&nbsp;React,&nbsp;Redux, mostly/PSQL/AWS)</small> web stack. Yep, I wear glasses.</p>
      <p>Before glasses, I worked on making <a href="https://www.vecna.com/">Electronic Health Health Records</a> more useful and accessible. Way back when, I wrote code to run robots and test sensors. I still like hardware a bunch.</p>
      <p>Outside of work, I like to make stuff, mostly food, bikes, and ceramics. I also like riding the bikes.</p>
      <p>I have cat. His name's Lorenzo.</p>
