      <p>I'm George. I make software, usually to make the internal tools and web store at Warby Parker better. Currently I work across our Python/JS(+ React/Redux)/PSQL/AWS stack. Yep, I wear glasses.</p>
      <p>Previously I developed new features to make an Electronic Health Health Record solution more performant and accessible. Before that, I wrote code to run robots and test sensors. I still like hardware a bunch.</p>
      <p>Outside of work, I like to make stuff, mostly food, bikes, and ceramics. I also like riding the bikes.</p>
      <p>I have cat. His name's Lorenzo.</p>
