I'm George. I make software, usually to make the internal tools and web store at [Warby Parker](https://www.warbyparker.com) better. Currently I work across our <small>(Python/JS‚ÄìES6,&nbsp;React,&nbsp;Redux, PSQL, AWS)</small> web stack. Yep, I wear glasses.
Before glasses, I worked on making [Electronic Health Records](https://www.vecna.com/) more useful and accessible. Way back when, I wrote code to run robots and test sensors. I still like hardware a bunch.
Outside of work, I like to make stuff, mostly food, bikes, and ceramics. I also like riding the bikes.
I have a cat. His name's Lorenzo.
